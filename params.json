For a detailed README install procedures etc. plz have a look at the old repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/uzuzjmd/COMPBASE\r\n\r\nI will start to migrate the old wiki etc. here but this might take a while. Issues should now be attached to this repo. Pull requests for the submodules (espacially the portlets should be done with the old repo). This only contains the compbase without any UI code. If it is specific to the compbase use this repo to issue a pull request. Thank you very much.\r\n",
